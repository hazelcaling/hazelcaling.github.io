            <p>
                Hello! I‚Äôm Hazel Caling, a passionate software engineer with a strong background in logistics. I completed an immersive Software Development course at <a href="https://www.appacademy.io/" className='aboutme-link' target='_blank'>App Academy</a>, focusing on full-stack web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                With over 12 years of experience in the logistics industry, I developed a fascination with technology and its potential to transform operations. This curiosity drove me to explore software development, where I discovered my passion for problem-solving and creating efficient solutions. Transitioning from logistics to software engineering has equipped me with a unique perspective, allowing me to leverage my analytical skills and experience in optimizing processes to build impactful applications.
